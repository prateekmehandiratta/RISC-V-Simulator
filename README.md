# RISC-V-Simulator
Implementation of a function simulator in C/C++ for 32bit RISCV ISA instructions

Overall code is divided into 4 phases. 
PHASE1: This part takes the RISC-V instructions in the "input.asm" file and converts into the machine code("machine_code.mc" file) for further processing.Read the README file in phase1 folder for more details.
